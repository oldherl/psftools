.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP 
psf2wyse converts a font in the .PSF format to a soft-font suitable for use
with Wyse-60 and compatible terminals. The resulting soft-font can be saved
as a text file, or just sent straight to the terminal.
.\"
.\"------------------------------------------------------------------
.\"
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B --bank=BANK
The Wyse-60 has four banks of 128 characters each, numbered 0 to 3. By default
the first two contain the 16-pixel font used in 25-line modes, and the second
two contain the 9-pixel font used in 43-line modes. This option sets the 
first bank to load into; note that psf2wyse will load into subsequent banks 
if there are more characters in the font than will fit into one.
.TP
.B --dest=DEST
Specifies the first character to populate in the destination bank. By default 
this is zero.
.TP 
.B --first=FIRST
Starts generating the font at character FIRST.
.TP 
.B --last=LAST
Finishes generating the font after doing character LAST.
.TP 
.B --height=HEIGHT
Sets the height of the characters which will be sent to the terminal. By 
default this is 16, whatever the height of the font being converted; on a 
Wyse-60, attempts to define characters at other heights appear to be ignored.
.TP 
.B --nulls=COUNT
After sending the definition for a character, send COUNT null bytes. This 
appears to be necessary to make sure the terminal doesn't miss the start of a 
character while it's still processing the previous character. By default 
COUNT is 8.

.\"------------------------------------------------------------------
.\"
.SH BUGS
The terminal screen tends to flicker like crazy while characters not in the 
current bank are being defined.
