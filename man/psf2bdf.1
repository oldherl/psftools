.SH DESCRIPTION
psf2bdf saves some or all characters from a .PSF font to an X11-format BDF
font file. The resulting file should then be tidied up in an editor such
as xmbdfed(1) before being installed.

.\"------------------------------------------------------------------
.\"
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B --codepage=x
Extracts only the characters in the given codepage (requires the source
PSF file to have a Unicode directory). Any characters in the codepage not
present in the source font are replaced by blanks. The codepage can be
specified by number or name; see psfpages(1) for a list of acceptable 
codepage names.
.TP
.B --first=n
Extracts characters starting at the specified character. 
.TP
.B --last=n
Extracts characters up to and including the specified character. 
.TP
.B --256
Equivalent to --first=0 --last=255.
.TP
.B --fontname=name
Sets the XLFD name of the font being output.
.TP
.B --descent=n 
Sets the descent (pixels between the character baseline and the bottom of the
character cell). If this is not entered it is assumed to be 1/4 of the 
character height.
.TP
.B --defchar=n
Sets the number of the default character to use.
.TP
.B --iso10646
If this option is present and the source file has a Unicode directory, the 
font will encode the ID of each character as its Unicode position. Otherwise
the character's ID is equal to its position in the file.
.LP
If a codepage and a range of characters are both specified, the range
is applied to the subset of characters extracted by the codepage.

.SH BUGS
The BDF needs tidying up after generation, as mentioned above.
