This directory gives examples of how a font held in a set of 'master' PSF files
can be used to generate character sets for a variety of different systems. The
"mkfonts" script currently generates the following file types:

* The "master" PSF files, from TXT files.
* DOS codepage (CPI) files. In fact it builds codepages in three formats -
 normal, DRDOS, and Windows NT.
* PSF1 files for use as PC-GEM system fonts. PSF1 is used since the font editor
 I wrote for PC-GEM uses this file format.
* ROM dumps for Amstrad PC1512 and PPC512 computers.
* Raw binary font for CP/M on an Amstrad PCW.
* .TAP for Spectrums.

  More could doubtless be added, such as X11 and Windows.

  The sample PSF files are based on the fonts in the GPLed release of GEM;
so for jurisdictions where bitmap fonts can be copyrighted, these fonts 
are released under the terms of the GPL.

  To run mkfonts, pass the base name(s) of the font(s) to build - eg, 

./mkfonts gsans tsans
